Pixel art is both a constraint and a creative opportunity. Working with limited resolution forces you to think carefully about every pixel.

## Getting Started

1. **Start Small**: Begin with 16x16 or 32x32 canvases
2. **Limited Palette**: Use 4-8 colors initially
3. **Study References**: Look at classic games and pixel artists

## Key Techniques

### Dithering

Dithering creates the illusion of additional colors by alternating pixels in a pattern.

### Anti-aliasing

Softening hard edges with intermediate colors makes sprites look smoother.

### Clustering

Group similar colors together to create readable forms.

## Tools I Use

- Aseprite (paid)
- Piskel (free, web-based)
- GraphicsGale (free)

Remember: every pixel counts!
