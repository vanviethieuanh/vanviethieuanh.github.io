Brutalist web design embraces the raw, unpolished nature of the web. It's about stripping away unnecessary decoration and focusing on function and content.

## Core Principles

- **Bold Typography**: Use strong, impactful fonts
- **Thick Borders**: Heavy borders that create visual hierarchy
- **Limited Color Palette**: Often monochromatic or using minimal colors
- **Raw HTML**: Sometimes showing the structure of the web

## Why Brutalism?

In a world of polished, corporate websites, brutalism stands out. It's honest, direct, and unapologetic.

```css
.brutalist-button {
  border: 3px solid black;
  background: yellow;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

The web doesn't need to be perfect. It needs to be functional.
